This is the portfolio website repository of Rodel van Rooijen. This is an
adaption of the open source portfolio website found
[here](https://github.com/michael-pfister/deno-portfolio/).

This website is using a combination of Deno and Typescript.

## Deployment

- Deployment is based [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). If you’re new to
  this, don’t worry! Check out the
  [Deployment Guide](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started/deploy-to-production)
  in the
  [denoland fresh documentation](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/introduction) for
  step-by-step instructions.
- In Github the deployment is done through workflow actions.

## Setting Up Locally

1. Start the development server by executing `deno task start`
2. This makes the website available on `localhost:8000`
